# Dijkstra's Algorythm

## Some funfacts:
- Dutch theorytical physicist, did a lot in CS too (no, not Counter Strike!)
- algorythm is a "find shortest way between places" algorythm (weighted graph traversal)
- he wanted to present an easily understandable problem to the public where it's easily understandable how much a computer can simplify, he made it up in a coffe table under 20 minutes... this isn't his thesis, or life's work... but an excellently smart thingy
