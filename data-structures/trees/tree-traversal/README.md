# Tree Traversal
This is an action meaning an algorythm visiting each nodes of a tree.
Any sort of tree

It is the "print", "list" function of a tree.

2 common ways: `Breadth-first` and `Depth-first`

## Breadth-first
Going through each "breadth" of a tree. It means a "stage" just like in a tall building.
At first "stage 1", than 2 and so on till the end.

## Depth-first
Going from one end (top or bottom no matter) of the tree, and working towards the other direction.
