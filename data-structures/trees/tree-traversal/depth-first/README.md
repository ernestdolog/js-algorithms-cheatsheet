# Depth-first Tree Traversal
Going from one end to the other. 

There are 3 ways:
 - PreOrder: Starting from the root working down reaching the depth of the Tree.
 - PostOrder
 - InOrder

> Here we are doing some recursion. Very interesting, eye opener stuff!

> From recursive solutions we study from the power and real usage of recursion. It is a kind of a loop. Loops are really great for looping sequentially front of backwards. But when we have a tree-like branched pattern where we want to loop, looping is not enough. Here comes recursion in the picture. This fills the hole,and offers us unlimited opportunity to loop basically in any kind of parth through each steps. Amazing stuff, isn't it? :) :) :)
