# Tree
A data structure consists Node-s in a `parent`/`child` relationship.
A Node can only point to a child (only down). If there is different directions in the data structure -> it is not a tree.

Tree is a non-linear data structure.

`root` -> top Node in a tree
`child` -> Node directly connected to a Node when moving away from the root
`parent` -> converse of a child
`siblings` -> group of Nodes with the same parent
`leaf` -> Node with no children
`edge` -> a connection between Nodes

> Used by for example: HTML DOM, Abstract syntax trees (trees are used many times to describe syntax of a language), AI - decision trees

There are special kinds of trees... by number of nodes there are:

binary tree: one node can have maximum 2 children
trinary tree: one node can have maximum 3 children
quadrinary tree: one node can have maximum 3 children
