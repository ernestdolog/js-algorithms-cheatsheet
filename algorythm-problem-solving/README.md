# Algorithms and problem solving

**Algorithm** is a process of steps to accomplish a task.

### How to solve a programming challenge:
#### 1. understand the problem:
 - can I restate the problem with my own words?
 - what are the inputs that go into the problem?
 - what are the outputs coming out from the solution of the problem?
 - can the outputs be determined by the inputs? (do i have enough information?)
 - how should I label the important pieces of data that are parts of the problem?
#### 2. make some concrete examples
#### 3. break it down to sub problems
#### 4. solve or simplify the problem
#### 5. look back and refactor
